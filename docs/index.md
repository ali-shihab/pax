# Pax - Multi-Agent Learning in JAX

Pax is an experiment runner for multi-agent research built on top of JAX. It supports "other agent shaping", "multi agent RL" and "single agent RL" experiments. It supports regular and meta agents, and evolutionary and RL-based optimisation. 

> *Pax (noun) - a period of peace that has been forced on a large area, such as an empire or even the whole world*
